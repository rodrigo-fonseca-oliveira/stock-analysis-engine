TA-Lib Wrappers
===============

The analysis engine includes a wrapper for `talib <https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib>`__. This wrapper imports with:

::

    import analysis_engine.ae_talib as ae_talib
    
Use this wrapper if you want to run unittests that need to access talib functions. This approach is required because not all testing platforms support installing talib. If ``import talib`` fails, then ``import analysis_engine.mocks.mock_talib as talib`` module is loaded instead. This wrapper provides lightweight functions that are compatible with python mocks and replicate the functionality of ``talib``.
